DynamicFieldFlow is a library that allows to simulate neural dynamic architectures built using [DynamicFieldPy](https://github.com/danielsabinasz/DynamicFieldPy) by means of the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) framework, and to train the parameters of such architectures via backpropagation through time.
